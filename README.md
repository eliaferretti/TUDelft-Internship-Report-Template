# TUDelft Internship Report LaTeX Template

This repository provides a LaTeX template for writing internship reports at Delft University of Technology (TU Delft). The template is designed to meet the formatting requirements typically expected for internship reports submitted at TU Delft.

## TUDelft guidlines

During your internship, you are expected to write a report about the content of your project. The report needs to have an academic level. The report is written for the company and should therefore follow the **format and guidelines of the company**.
In addition to or in absence of company guidelines, the report could consist of (at least) the following:
- Front page with your name, student number, names of supervisors, subject
- Brief description of the company and department
- Activities during the internship
- Problem statement
- Approach (description of the process)
- Results
- Conclusion/recommendations (in which you include a link to theory that is relevant to your MSc programme when possible)
- Learning process (which skills did you acquire/develop during the internship)
- Bibliography
